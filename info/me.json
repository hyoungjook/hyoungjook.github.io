I'm a second-year PhD student in the <a href=\"https://csd.cmu.edu/\">Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University</a>, advised by Professor <a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gibbons/\">Phil Gibbons</a>. I am interested in designing <strong>Database Systems</strong> for <strong>Next-Generation Hardwares</strong>. I am currently working on Databases for <strong>Processing-in-Memory</strong> by pushing code towards data. Before coming to CMU, I did my undergraduate at <a href=\"https://en.snu.ac.kr/\">Seoul National University</a> and worked on Machine Learning Systems, CUDA programming, and GPU architectures."
