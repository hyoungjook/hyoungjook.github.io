I'm a second-year PhD student in the <a href=\"https://csd.cmu.edu/\">Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University</a>, advised by <a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gibbons/\"><i>Phil Gibbons</i></a> and closely working with <a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/\"><i>Andy Pavlo</i></a>. I am interested in designing <strong>Database Systems</strong> for <strong>Novel Hardwares</strong>. My current research explores the potential of <strong>Processing-in-Memory</strong> on <strong>Transaction Processing</strong> by pushing code towards data. Before coming to CMU, I did my undergraduate at <a href=\"https://en.snu.ac.kr/\">Seoul National University</a> and worked on Machine Learning Systems and GPUs."
